The .appLogic files will be used to keep track of the project structure as we build it.
  - Keep the .appLogic fresh in your mind as you write the code.
  - Read this as needed but do not edit it.
  - follow this as closely as possible.

Coding style:
  - write one line comments to make it easy for me to read your code.
  - keep the code clean and readable.
  - keep the code minimal and to the point.
  - setup good logging along the way.
  - use good variable names.
  - use easy to understand function names.

Project structure:
  - split into /src/frontend and /src/backend
  - packaged in a docker container.
  - use docker compose to run the container.

Backend:
  - uses NodeJS

Frontend:
  - uses tailwindcss
  - uses javascript
